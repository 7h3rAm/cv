- name: svachal + machinescli
  brief: These tools are useful for creating and learning from CTF writeups
  description: Writeups for CTF challenges and machines are a critical learning resource for our community. For the author, it presents an opportunity to document their methodology, tips/tricks and progress. For the audience, it serves as reference material. Oftentimes, authors switch roles and become the audience to learn from their own work. This demo aims to showcase tools, svachal and machinescli, developed with these insights. These work in conjunction to help users curate their learning in .yml structured files, find insights and query this knowledge base as and when needed.

- name: Angad - Malware Detection using Multi-Dimensional Visualization
  brief: Angad is a tool that can perform visual malware clustering using Hilbert Curves
  description: Angad is a framework to automate classification of an unlabelled malware dataset using multi-dimensional modelling. The input dataset is analyzed to collect various attributes which are then arranged in a number of feature vectors. These vectors are then individually visualized, indexed and then queried for each new input file. Matching vectors are labelled as per their AV detection categories (could be changed to a heuristics approach if needed). If dynamic behavior or network traffic details are available, respective vectors are converted into activity graphs that depict evolution on a predefined time scale. This results into an animation of a malware or a malware category's behaviorial traits and is useful in identifying activity overlaps across the input dataset.

- name: Visual Network and File Forensics
  brief: This presentation showcases the effectiveness of visual tooling for malware and file-format forensics
  description: This presentation aims to demo the effectiveness of visual tooling for malware and file-format forensics. It will cover structural analysis and visualization of malware and network artifacts. Various techniques like entropy/n-gram visualization, using compression-ratio and theoretical minsize to identify file type and packed content will be shown. Along with this, a framework that helps automate these tasks will be presented. Attendees with an interest in network monitoring, signature writing, malware analysis and forensics will find this presentation to be useful.

- name: Rudra - The Destroyer of Evil
  brief: Rudra provides a framework for exhaustive analysis of PCAP and PE files
  description: Rudra aims to provide a developer-friendly framework for exhaustive analysis of PCAP and PE files. It provides features to scan and generate reports that include file's structural properties, entropy visualization, compression ratio, theoretical minsize, etc. These details, alongwith file-format specific analysis information, help an analyst to understand the type of data embedded in a file and quickly decide if it deserves further investigation. It supports scanning PE files and can perform API scans, anti{debug, vm, sandbox} detection, packer detection, authenticode verification, alongwith Yara, shellcode, and regex detection upon them.

- name: Flowinspect - Network Inspection Tool on Steroids
  brief: Flowinspect is a tool for network monitoring and inspection purposes
  description: Flowinspect is a tool developed specifically for network monitoring and inspection purposes. It takes network traffic as input and extracts layer 4 flows from it. These flows are then passed through an inspection engine that filters and extracts interesting network sessions. For flows that meet inspection criteria, the output mode dumps match statistics to either stdout or a file or both.
