talks:
- name: Visual Network and File Forensics
  brief: This presentation aims to demo the effectiveness of visual tooling for malware and file-format forensics
  description: This presentation aims to demo the effectiveness of visual tooling for malware and file-format forensics. It will cover structural analysis and visualization of malware and network artifacts. Various techniques like entropy/n-gram visualization, using compression-ratio and theoretical minsize to identify file type and packed content will be shown. Along with this, a framework that helps automate these tasks will be presented. Attendees with an interest in network monitoring, signature writing, malware analysis and forensics will find this presentation to be useful.

- name: Rudra - The Destroyer of Evil
  brief: Rudra aims to provide a developer-friendly framework for exhaustive analysis of PCAP and PE files
  description: Rudra aims to provide a developer-friendly framework for exhaustive analysis of PCAP and PE files. It provides features to scan and generate reports that include file's structural properties, entropy visualization, compression ratio, theoretical minsize, etc. These details, alongwith file-format specific analysis information, help an analyst to understand the type of data embedded in a file and quickly decide if it deserves further investigation. It supports scanning PE files and can perform API scans, anti{debug, vm, sandbox} detection, packer detection, authenticode verification, alongwith Yara, shellcode, and regex detection upon them.

- name: Flowinspect - Network Inspection Tool on Steroids
  brief: Flowinspect is a tool developed specifically for network monitoring and inspection purposes
  description: Flowinspect is a tool developed specifically for network monitoring and inspection purposes. It takes network traffic as input and extracts layer 4 flows from it. These flows are then passed through an inspection engine that filters and extracts interesting network sessions. For flows that meet inspection criteria, the output mode dumps match statistics to either stdout or a file or both.
